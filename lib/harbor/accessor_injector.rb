module Harbor
  ##
  # A simple module to facilitate accessor based injection. This is used by Harbor::Plugin
  # to allow you to easily construct plugins from hashes, i.e.:
  # 
  #   <%= plugin("user/tabs", :user => @user)
  # 
  # It can of course be used for anything, however:
  # 
  #   class Dog
  #     include Harbor::AccessorInjector
  #     attr_accessor :owner
  #   end
  # 
  #   dog = Dog.new.inject(:owner => "Tom")
  #   dog.owner # => "Tom"
